# Jewelry Collector - django project

This is a django project using python, django and sql to implement Index, Post,
Show and Delete (all CRUD actions) on a model of Jewelry.   It uses postgresql to
store the Jewelry model(data).

It was created inside an environment folder setup by pipenv install.

The idea was to practice everything learned in class and to setup a django project
ourselves while also practicing creating all the views classes necessary for our
project.
